                <h2>The Color of Tea (2012)</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>An exciting debut novel set in the exotic, bustling streets of coastal China about a woman whose life is restored when she opens a small café and gains the courage to trust what’s in her heart.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Macau: the bulbous nose of China, a peninsula and two islands strung together like a three-bead necklace. It was time to find a life for myself. To make something out of nothing. The end of hope and the beginning of it too.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After moving with her husband to the tiny, bustling island of Macau, Grace Miller finds herself a stranger in a foreign land—a lone redhead towering above the crowd on the busy Chinese streets. As she is forced to confront the devastating news of her infertility, Grace’s marriage frays and her dreams of family shatter. She resolves to do something bold, something her impetuous mother would do, and she turns to what she loves: baking and the pleasure of afternoon tea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grace opens a café where she serves tea, coffee, and macarons—the delectable, delicate French cookies colored like precious stones—to the women of Macau. There, among fellow expatriates and locals alike, Grace carves out a new definition of home and family. But when her marriage reaches a crisis, secrets Grace thought she had buried long ago rise to the surface. Grace realizes it’s now or never to lay old ghosts to rest and to begin to trust herself. With each mug of coffee brewed, each cup of tea steeped and macaron baked, Grace comes to learn that strength can be gleaned from the unlikeliest of places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>A delicious, melt-in-your-mouth novel featuring the sweet pleasures of French pastries and the exotic scents and sights of China, The Color of Tea is a scrumptious story of love, friendship and renewal.</i>
                </p>
                <h2>Season of Salt and Honey (2015)</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>From the author of the “sweet, airy novel” (Publishers Weekly) The Color of Tea comes a resonant new book about a woman starting over following the tragic loss of her fiancé.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frankie is a runaway bride. Or rather, she is running away from her fiancé’s funeral, the unthinkable event that has thrown her entire life into crisis. Frankie and Alex were high school sweethearts and each other’s first loves. They should have been together forever. But Alex died in a surfing accident, and now Frankie is walking away from her family, driving north and east, letting her body do the thinking, all the way into the Cascade Mountain range.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Alex’s family cabin, Frankie can give in to her grief and think about nothing. There are no aunts trying feed her just a few <i>polpette</i> or just a taste of <i>affogato</i>, despite her lack of appetite; none of Alex’s family around to look questioningly at her left ring finger, no one there to perform for. Except for Jack, the cabin’s caretaker, who has been tasked with forcing Frankie out of the property that isn’t rightfully hers. And except for Bella, Frankie’s wild-child younger sister who deserted the family years ago only to reappear at Frankie’s lowest moment to dredge up painful memories from the past.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Frankie learns she can’t hide—not from her family, not from the past, and not from truths about Alex she’d rather not face. The seasonal magic of the forest and its welcoming residents remind her that everything—flowers to bud, bread to rise, a heart to heal—takes its own time. This stunning novel, from the author of <i>The Color of Tea</i>, is a feast for the senses, with a message of forgiveness, hope, and the many ways to find and give love.
                </p>

                <h2>A French Wedding (2017)</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>For fans of The Vacationers and The Little Paris Bookshop: A delicious novel full of romantic entanglements, fiery outbursts, and a range of secrets, about six college friends reuniting on the coast of Brittany to celebrate one of their own’s fortieth birthday.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Max is a washed-up rock star who’s about to turn forty and feeling nostalgic for his university days. All he says he wants for his birthday is to host his old friends at his house in the French countryside for a weekend of good food and reminiscing. But he has an ulterior motive: Finally ready to settle down, this is his chance to declare his undying love to his best friend, Helen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Max’s private chef, Juliette, has just returned to her hometown after a nasty breakup and her parents’ failing health move her to sell her dream restaurant in Paris. Still reeling, Juliette throws herself into her job, hoping that the peace and quiet it offers will be the perfect cure for her broken heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when Max’s friends arrive, the introverted, dreamy Juliette finds herself drawn out of her orderly kitchen and into their tumultuous relationships. A weekend thinking about the past spurs more than one emotional crisis, as the friends take stock of whether they’ve lived up to their ideals. Together for the first time in years, it’s not long before love triangles, abandoned dreams, and long-held resentments bubble over, culminating in a wedding none of them ever expected.
                </p>
                <h2>The Pool (2024)</h2>
                <p>
                    Prince of spin and life of the party, Baz King, is missing. Nine years ago, at an innocent summer barbecue in Melbourne, everything imploded. For the Kings and the four other young families there that fateful day marriages fractured, friendships crumbled and lives were upended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing would ever be the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now in their forties and their children teenagers, Baz King cannot be found. Has his charm finally run out? With a history of dodgy dealings and no shortage of motives, anyone could be a suspect – his ex-wife, Birdie; his colleague, Alex Turner; his lover, Jess and her husband, Richard; his friend’s nanny and new wife, Madison – who wants him out of the picture?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>A biting domestic noir, The Pool examines the enduring shrapnel of tragedy: if you witness the worst thing imaginable, how does it change you? Could it make you a murderer?</i>
